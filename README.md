# Taking notes and Sinking boats

## Description

In this project we were given starter code and told to use express.js middleware to link the front end to the back end. The first thing I did was set up a server file. We imported express and other dependancies to get the front end to talk to the back end. We set up get, post, delete routes. Used express.static to open up the public folders for all files to use. I worked with a tutor and set this up months ago. I was able to get into insomnia and do most the routes at that time. After revisiting the assignment I was able to use a different logic, but left the old logic, which I believe would've given me a passing grade. The new logic is much better, and used less files. Just leaving it there for a paper trail and to revisit where I went wrong the first time.
